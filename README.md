# arms-allies
This repository contains TeX files as well as data and code for a forthcoming manuscript arguing that deep alliances decrease defense spending by junior alliance members, while shallow alliances increase defense spending. 

The repository contains everything needed to replicate the data construction process and analysis. The most straightforward way to replicate everything is to use `do-all.R`, which also shows the proper order for running the data cleaning and analysis scripts.

`alliance-measures` includes code to generate a latent measure of treaty depth, using observed data from the [ATOP project](http://www.atopdata.org/)
