# arms-allies
This repository contains TeX files as well as R and STAN code for my prelim paper on the arms and alliances tradeoff. I argue that the design of alliance treaties alters the credibility of those treaties, and which then affects military spending by member states. 

The data folder contains everything needed to replicate the data construction process and analysis. Use `dataset construction and summary.R` to create the dataset. `analysis.R` runs the main model I present in the paper, some diagnostic checks, and summarizes the output. `model comparison.R` compares the full model to two simpler specifications using loo and WAIC.
